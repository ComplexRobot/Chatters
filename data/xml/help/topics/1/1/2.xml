<topic name="1.1.2 Chatting in Channels">
	<info>Chatters consists of seperate channels. A channel is simply a chat room where a group of people can converse together in real time. You are a guest in the channel, and should act politely towards others. Unruly behavior can cause you to be kicked out of the channel, or banned from it completely. You can also have your voice taken, prohibiting your ability to speak openly in the channel.

Remember that there are many channels to choose from, so you may not always feel comfortable in every one. And also, you can host your own channel if nothing suits you. There you make the rules and enforce them. Some people find this to be the only good way to use a chat room.</info>
