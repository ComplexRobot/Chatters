
Message Format
	A string that describes the format of a message, with keywords that
	act as place holders for dynamic data to be filled in at runtime.
	Formats have required keywords, such as '$name' and '$msg.' Both must
	be present in the Chat Format for it to be valid.

	The format may contain approved HTML tags, text and punctuation in
	any order or arrangement that is desired, so long as all required
	keywords are present. Message formats have the following keywords.

	$name - The name of the person saying the message
	$msg  - The message being said
	$ts   - Time the message was said, displayed according to a time format.
	$rp   - An inline action passed with a said message.
	says  - Auto-replaced with asks and exclaims where appropriate
	said  - Auto-replaced with asked and exclaimed where appropriate

	The following setting affects all message formats.

	Forced Punctuation - If the message lacks punctuation, add a period to
	the end of the message. If the format has the keyword 'said' or 'says'
	after the message, then add a comma instead of a period. If a period
	does end the message, but the keyword 'says' or 'said' follows the
	message in the format, then replace the period with a comma. A period
	may be added to the end of the message format to complete the
	sentence with the proper punctuation. It is up to the user to decide.

	Forced Punctuation is off by default.

	The default formats are as follows:

		Chat Format: "$ts <b>$name:</b>   $msg"

		RP Chat Format: "$ts $name $rp:   $msg"

		Emote Format: "$ts $name $msg"


Time Format
	A string that describes the format of a timestamp, with keywords that
	act as place holders for dynamic data to be filled in at runtime.

	The format may contain approved HTML tags, text and punctuation in
	any order or arrangement that is desired. The Time Format has the
	following keywords.

	hh - The hours value of the current time
	mm - The minutes value of the current time
	ss - The seconds value of the current time

	Hour: 24/12 - You may choose to have hours displayed in 12 or 24 hour
	format. If you choose the 12 hour format, the suffix 'am' or 'pm'
	will be added to the end of the timestamp to denote the time of day.

	The Hour format is set to 24 by default.

	The default Time Format is: "<b>[</b>hh:mm:ss<b>]</b>"
